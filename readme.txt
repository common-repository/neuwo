== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the purpose of this plugin? =

Full-time bloggers are branding and content professionals. A blogger with an established brand and readership today spends hours creating each individual content piece so that it engages their audience and, among other things, hits the necessary SEO marks. The number of impressions the content piece gets and e.g. eventual affiliate link clicks that then follow determine the livelihood of the blogging professional.  
 
Affiliate marketing is one source of income for blogs, which relies on the number of eyes (impressions) on the blog, and advertising is another source. But it’s not a very attractive method for a blogger with a specific brand image and quality content to pair it with random advertising. Ideally, the ads shown in each blog post would match the blogger’s brand and the particular content piece. This would make advertising less disruptive and more appealing to the blog’s audience.  

The problem has been though, that these kinds of ad targeting tools have not been available for the general blogosphere. We wanted to make a change in this! 
 
Quality content needs advertising that aligns with the content. With Neuwo’s contextual intelligence that understands natural language, the blogger can automatically discover content categories to utilize in targeted advertising. 
 
We specifically built an intelligent content categorization plugin for WordPress. The plugin can be used by any website that utilizes WordPress and it is designed specifically to help in tagging content and building segments for marketing.
